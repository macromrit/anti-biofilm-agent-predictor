# anti-biofilm-agent-predictor
This project focuses on predicting inhibition values of anti-biofilm agents using one-hot encodings of their SMILES representations. It employs manual feature engineering and regression models to make predictions, while also highlighting limitations such as data scarcity and potential loss of chemical information in the encoding process.
